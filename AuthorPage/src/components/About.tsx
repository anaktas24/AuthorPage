      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate Greek fantasy novelist, weaving tales of mythical worlds and epic adventures.
        My debut novel, <em>Through the Starlit Portal</em>, follows Jet, Aria, and Kiyo as they uncover
        secrets in a magical realm. Inspired by Greek mythology and 90s pop culture, I aim to transport
        readers to vibrant, unforgettable universes.

        When I'm not writing, you can find me exploring ancient ruins, sipping coffee in Athens caf√©s,
        or binge-watching classic 90s TV shows. Connect with me via the contact page or follow my blog
        for writing updates!
